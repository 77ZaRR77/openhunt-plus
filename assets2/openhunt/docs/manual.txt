=================================================================
=== Chapter 1
=== Gamestamps
===

Whenever a match is completed Hunt will generate two files:

   gamestamp.txt
   gamestamp.gs

"gamestamp.txt" contains some statistics about the match in a
readable format. "gamestamp.gs" contains the same information in
a compressed, checksummed, and encrypted format. If you mail me
the "gamestamp.gs" file, I can check and verify the conditions
and results of your match. This enables me to maintain a global
hall of fame. Check out http://www.planetquake.com/modifia/hunt/
for more information.

The "gamestamps" directory contains a history of the last 25
gamestamps, including the current one. This number is actually
determined by the cvar "g_maxGamestamps." So, e. g. to increase
the size of the history to 100 entries, start Q3A, open the
console and enter

	/g_maxgamestamps 100

The "highscores" directory contains gamestamps for local records.
This requires the usage of game templates, though.

PLEASE NOTE:
If you don't want Hunt to generate gamestamps, just set
"g_createGamestamps" to "0." On the other hand, if you want Hunt
to generate gamestamps, but it doesn't, make sure the cvar is
set to "1."




=================================================================
=== Chapter 2
=== Templates
===

Templates provide an easy, comfortable way to configure a match.
They can be useful in many cases.

   - You're new to Hunt and don't understand all these new
     options?

   - You've multiple favourite settings so you have to change the
     options frequently?

   - You want to enter the global hall of fame, and thus want to
     make sure you fulfill the requirements?

All of these problems can be solved by using templates, and they
can do even more! But let's proceed step by step.



=================================================================
=== Chapter 2.1
=== Using Templates
===

Templates can be used both before and during a match. When you
create a new match, either single player or multiplayer, you'll
notice a new entry at the top of the first "Game Server" page
(where you select the game type and map), reading "Game
Templates." Click on it to open the templates menu. You'll see a
list of templates. Choose one by clicking on it, then hit "Next."
You're presented the settings done by the template. Some entries
may be grayed out, so you can't change them, others may not. This
is especially important with the global hall of fame. If you
choosed such a template, all options grayed out can't be changed
without violating the requirements. You can edit any other option
to your liking. Finally, hit "Fight" to start the match.

The in-game menu contains an entry to show the game templates
page, too. Now it works a bit different, though. First of all,
the templates you see are actually installed at the server. You
can click one and hit "Vote" to call a vote for this template. If
the vote passes, the server will execute it.

You can save the settings of the current match in a local
template by entering a name at "Save Current Settings As" and
hitting the "Save" button. Since the name needs to be unique, you
may want to switch to "Show local templates."



=================================================================
=== Chapter 2.2
=== Creating Templates
===

The easiest way to create a template is to save the current
settings via the in-game menu. These are stored as cvars in the
"q3config.cfg" file in your Hunt installation directory. These
cvars always have the name "savedNNN," where "NNN" is a number
between 000 and 999.

You can also create template files, each of which can store up to
1000 templates. A template file must be stored in the "templates"
directory of your Hunt installation directory. There should
already be a template file "default.tmpl," which contains the
standard templates provided by Hunt. A template file is just a
normal config file that contains a series of "deftemplate"
statements. Each of these statements defines a template string.

The template string is a standard config string, that is, it
looks like this:

   "key1\val1\key2\val2\ ... \keyN\valN"

Note that the order of the keys is not important.

The following list shows all valid keys and their values. Some
keys are required while others are optional. When a key is
flagged as "D/F," this means the value must be preceeded with
either a "d" or "f." In this case, "d" means the value is used
only as a *d*efault, which may be overwritten by the user, while
"f" marks values that should be *f*orced to come into use. Values
marked by "f" are grayed out at the game server menu, and if the
value is overwritten during the match, Hunt won't register a
highscore. Note that values not flagged as "D/F" are always
treated as "f" values, if a value is provided.

   - mph        [optional, D/F]
     Defines the progression of the monster constitution (cvar
     g_monsterprogression, see chapter 5.1). This key is only

   - ht         [optional]
     Defines the type of highscore to be maintained for this
     template. Valid values are
        - 0 = no highscore

        - 3 = distance challenge (the farthest distance covered
              is recorded)
        - 4 = speed challenge (the highest speed is recorded)
     If this key is not provided or the value is out of range, it
     defaults to 0.

   - hn         [optional]
     Defines the name of the cvars used to store the highscore.
     For example, if the highscore name is "myhighscore," the
     highscore is stored in "myhighscore0" and "myhighscore1." If
     this key is not provided, it defaults to the template name.




=================================================================
=== Chapter 3
=== Game Seed
===

The game seed is used to initialize Hunt's internal random number
generator (RNG). The RNG is used to determine

   - the spawn point of players

   - the spawn point of monsters

   - the spawn point of artefacts

   - the behavior of monsters

Note that bots are (currently) not affected by the RNG.

If the game seed is set to zero, the RNG is initialized randomly,
that is, you can't predict anything.

On the other hand, if the game seed is set to a number between 1
and 65535, this number is used to initialize the RNG. This means,
if you keep the game seed to a constant non-zero value, you can
predict (to a certain extent) all aspects that are affected by
the RNG. Note that, since the behaviour of monsters is also
affected by you, you can't predict this aspect too precisely.

Of course, you can't derive anything just from the number. You
have to play a match to figure out how it's arranged. But when
you restart it, you can be sure that everything works (much) as
before.

The advantage is, you can train the game as in the good old days
of 2D shooters. This matches the fact that Hunt can maintain a
highscore as in the good old days of 2D shooters.




=================================================================
=== Chapter 4
=== New Callvotes
===

The callvote command now accepts two new aspects to vote for.

1. callvote addbot <name> <skill> [team]

   Use this command to call a vote for adding a bot. <name> is
   the name of the model. <skill> is a number between 1 and 5,
   where

      - 1 means "I can win"
      - 2 means "Bring it on"
      - 3 means "Hurt me plenty"
      - 4 means "Hardcore"
      - 5 means "Nightmare"

   In team games you can specify the team the bot should be added
   to. Use "red" or just "r" for the red team, and "blue" or just
   "b" for the blue team.

   Example:
   /callvote sarge 5 blue
   adds Sarge with nightmare skill to the blue team.

   To remove a bot use the "callvote kick <name>" command.


2. callvote template <internal template number>

   Since there's no command to find out the internal template
   number, I strongly recommend to use the in-game menu's "game
   templates" page to call a vote for a template.




=================================================================
=== Chapter 5
=== Console Variables
===

Hunt should support all of the original console variables
(cvars).
But please note:
   - As there's no quad damage powerup in Hunt, the g_quadfactor
     variable is ignored.

   - There're no weapons to collect in Hunt, so g_weaponrespawn
     and g_weaponteamrespawn are ignored, too.



=================================================================
=== Chapter 5.1
=== Server Side Console Variables
===

Most of the following cvars are actually covered by the user
interface. You can safely ignore this chapter unless you want to
set up a dedicated Internet server.



=== General Game Options

g_gametype              [0,1,3,4,8,9, default is 0] INTEGER
   0   Free For All
   1   Tournament
   3   Team Deathmatch
   4   Capture The Flag
   8   Save The Universe
   9   Escape From Hell

g_gameseed              [0 ... 65535, default is 0] INTEGER
   Defines the game seed.
   See chapter 3 of this manual for more information.

g_basehealth            [1 ... 1000, default is 300] INTEGER
   Defines the standard health and armor value of all players.
   Players can have health and armor values of up to
   2*g_basehealth. If health or armor are above g_basehealth, the
   value will drop slowly to g_basehealth. You'll get the
   standard Q3A behaviour by setting g_basehealth to 100.

g_armorfragments        [0 or 1, default is 0] INTEGER
   If set to 1, players will scatter around collectable "armor
   fragments" when hit.
   See chapter 9 of the tutorial for more information.

g_stamina               [0 or 1, default is 0] INTEGER
   If set to 1, players will exhaust and slow down when running
   or jumping too much.
   See chapter 14 of the tutorial for more information.

respawndelay            [0 ... 999, default is 10] INTEGER
   Fragged players have to wait this much seconds before they can
   respawn.
   This variable is ignored in Tournament matches.
   See chapter 13 of the tutorial for more information.

g_grapple               [0 ... 4, default is 0] INTEGER
   Defines the grappling hook mode. You can use these numbers:
      0 "disabled" - no grappling hook available
      1 "classic"  - the hook works as in plain Q3A
      2 "tool"     - a hook that is meant to be a tool for
                     reaching places you otherwise can't reach
      3 "anchor"   - a hook suited for camping
      4 "combat"   - a hook suited for combat & camping
   See chapter 10 of the tutorial for more information.

g_lightningdamagelimit  [default is 0] FLOAT
   Generally, the lightning gun's charge causes the more damage
   the more charge is accumulated at a player. By assigning a
   value greater than zero to this cvar you can set an upper
   limit to the charge damage. For example, if
   g_lightningdamagelimit is set to 10, charges above 10
   (seconds) would constantly cause damage of 10 hit points per
   second.
   Setting this cvar to a small value (like 1 or 0.1) would make
   it nearly impossible to kill with the lightning gun. It could
   still be used to reveal cloaked players, though.

g_noitems               [0 or 1, default is 0] INTEGER
   If set to 1, no items will spawn except from flags.

g_nohealthregen         [0 or 1, default is 0] INTEGER
   If set to 1, players will neither recharge health nor armor.

g_meeting               [0 or 1, default is 0] INTEGER
   If set to 1, the game will not start before every player has
   signalled to be ready. Anyone trying to connect while the game
   is in progress will be rejected.
   This variable has been introduced mainly to overcome a bug in
   the Quake3 engine causing clients to crash while connecting to
   an EFH game in progress. Therefor, it's highly recommended to
   set this cvar to 1 for EFH games. With LAN games this cvar may
   also be useful for other game types.

g_monsterlauncher       [0 or 1, default is 0] INTEGER
   If set to 1, all players will be equipped with an additional
   weapon (the "monster launcher"). This cvar is ignored in
   game types 8 (STU) and 9 (EFH).

g_maxmonsterspp         [default is 10] INTEGER
   The name of this cvar is short for "maximum number of monsters
   per player." It limits the amount of ammunition available for
   the monster launcher.

g_unlimitedammo         [0 or 1, default is 0] INTEGER
   If set to 1, players will have unlimited ammunition for all
   weapons except the monster launcher.

g_cloakingdevice        [0 or 1, default is 1] INTEGER
   If set to 0, players no longer have the cloaking device.

g_weaponlimit           [default is 0] INTEGER
   Determines the maximum number of weapons per player. At the
   beginning of a match, players will still find all weapons in
   their arsenal. They select a weapon by firing it. Once they
   reach the weapon limit, they're restricted to the choosen
   weapons. This restriction then holds until the end of the
   match.
   A limit of 0 means, there's no limit.



=== FFA Specific

no cvars so far



=== Tournament Specific

no cvars so far



=== Team Game (TDM+CTF) Specific

tss                     [0 or 1, default is 1] INTEGER
   If set to 0, players are not able to activate the TSS
   (Tactical Support System).
   See chapter 15 to 24 of the tutorial for more information.

tssSafetyModeAllowed    [0 or 1, deault is 1] INTEGER
   If set to 1, team leaders are allowed to enter a special
   "safety mode." This variable is ignored, if the "tss" is 0.
   See chapter 19 of the tutorial for more information.



=== TDM Specific

no cvars so far



=== CTF Specific

respawnatpod            [0 or 1, default is 0] INTEGER
   If set to 1, players are allowed to respawn at their place of
   death. Note that this variable is ignored if "respawndelay" is
   lower than 10 seconds.
   See chapter 13 of the tutorial for more information.



=== "Save the Universe" (STU)

See chapter 25 of the tutorial for more information about the
following cvars.

g_artefacts             [0 ... 999, default is 8] INTEGER
   Number of artefacts to be collected by the players.
   999 means "unlimited."

g_minmonsters           [0 ... 200, default is 15] INTEGER
   If at any time less monsters are alive than specified by this
   variable, new monsters will respawn at a high rate until this
   limit is reached again.

g_maxmonsters           [1 ... 200, default is 30] INTEGER
   Upper limit for the number of monsters alive. Should be
   adapted to the size of the map and the number of players.

g_monsterspawndelay     [200...999999, default is 10000] INTEGER
   If the number of monsters is between g_minmonsters and
   g_maxmonsters, they spawn at this rate (specified in
   milliseconds).

g_monsterspertrap       [default is 0] INTEGER
   Determines the number of monsters spawning when an artefact is
   collected.

g_monsterguards         [0 ... 100, default is 12] INTEGER
   Determines the average part of monsters spawning as guards.

g_monstertitans         [0 ... 100, default is 6] INTEGER
   Determines the average part of monsters spawning as titans.

g_monsterhealthscale    [1 ... 1000, default is 100] INTEGER
   Determines the monster constitution. The smaller the value the
   easier it is to kill a monster. g_monsterhealhscale set to
   100% results in these health values:

      - predators:   300 health      0 armor
      - guards:     1000 health   1000 armor
      - titans:     5000 health      0 armor

   Note that g_monsterhealthscale also scales armor.

g_monsterprogression    [default is 0] INTEGER
   Determines the progression in monster constitution as a
   percentage of g_monsterhealthscale per each minute played.

   This is only applied when a monster spawns, that is, its
   constitution (= maximum health value) doesn't change during
   its lifetime. (But note that monsters slowly recharge their
   health.)

g_monsterbreeding       [0 or 1, default is 1] INTEGER
   If set to 0, predators will stop creating cocoons.

g_skipendsequence       [0 or 1, default is 0] INTEGER
   If set to 1, the end sequence showing all monsters charging
   and exploding is skipped. That is, all players are moved to
   the intermission as soon as the last artefact is collected.

monstermodel1           [default is "klesk/maneater"] STRING
   Determines the model to be used by all clients for the
   "predator" monster.

monstermodel2           [default is "tankjr/default"] STRING
   Determines the model to be used by all clients for the "guard"
   monster.

monstermodel3           [default is "uriel/default"] STRING
   Determines the model to be used by all clients for the "titan"
   monster.

g_scoreMode             [0 ... 1, default is 0] INTEGER
   If set to 0, you earn a fixed score for each monster killed.
   If set to 1, the score depends on the monster constitution.
   With g_monsterprogression > 0 this means your score raises
   during the game.



=== "Escape From Hell" (EFH)

distancelimit           [default is 3000] INTEGER
   Determines the minimum length of the map in metres. Due to
   technical restrictions the actual length generally is slightly
   higher. A distancelimit of zero means the map is endless.

g_challengingenv        [0 or 1, default is 1] INTEGER
   If set to 0, the map generator omits those parts of the map
   that are specified by the map's author to be more challenging
   than usual.

g_monsterload           [0 ... 1000, default is 30] INTEGER
   Determines how many percent of the monsters specified in the
   are actually allowed to spawn (on average).

The following STU variables also apply to EFH:
   - g_monsterguards
   - g_monstertitans
   - g_monsterhealthscale
   - monstermodel1
   - monstermodel2
   - monstermodel3



=== Gamestamps

g_creategamestamps      [0 or 1, default is 1] INTEGER
   If set to 0, no gamestamps are created.
   See chapter 1 of this manual for more information.

g_maxgamestamps         [default is 25] INTEGER
   This is the size of the gamestamp history in the "gamestamps"
   directory.
   See chapter 1 of this manual for more information.




=================================================================
=== Chapter 5.2
=== Client Side Console Variables
===

Most client side cvars are covered by the user interface. Only
the few that aren't, are listed here.

cg_drawnummonsters      [0 or 1, default is 0] INTEGER
   If set to 1, the number of monsters currently alive is
   displayed in the HUD (top right corner).

cg_drawsegment          [0 or 1, default is 0] INTEGER
   If set to 1, the current segment is shown in the HUD for EFH
   maps.

cg_mapflare		[0 ... 2, default is 2] INTEGER
   Determines the quality of lens flares caused by map lights.

      0 = no lens flares
      1 = normal quality
      2 = high quality

   "High quality" results in a more realistic fading of some
   flares, for example the flares of the lights above and around
   the generator in q3tourney1, and the flares of the jets below
   the movers in q3dm19. Note that this feature increases CPU
   load depending on how many high quality flares are visible.
   Also note that there's an optimization that results in no FPS
   drop being noticable as long as neither you nor the (high
   quality flares causing) lights are visible. I recommend to use
   q3dm19 to check your frame rate.

cg_sunflare		[0 ... 2, default is 2] INTEGER
   Determines the quality of lens flares caused by the sun.

      0 = no lens flares
      1 = normal quality
      2 = high quality

   See cg_mapflare for more information.
   
   At the time of writing, the only map with a sun flare was
   efh01.

cg_missileflare		[0 or 1, default is 1] INTEGER
   If set to 0, turns off lens flares caused by missiles.

   At the time of writing, the only missile causing lens flares
   is the BFG shot.

cg_fireballtrail        [0 ... 2, default is 1] INTEGER
   Determines the quality of the fireballs shot by the guards.

      0 = no particle effects
      1 = fire particle effects
      2 = fire particle effects + hot air effects

cg_notrace              [0 or 1, default is 0] INTEGER
   If set to 1, some client effects don't use traces. Currently
   this affects only the lightning effects. Setting this cvar to
   1 can significantly increase the frame rate on computers with
   slow CPU.

ui_lensflare            [0 or 1, default is 1] INTEGER
   If set to 0, turns off the new "bright" cursor, switching back
   to the old standard cursor. This doesn't affect the in-game
   lens flares.

ui_hidetailtitle	[0 or 1, default is 1] INTEGER
   If set to 0, reduces the resolution of the title picture.
   Useful for for some graphics cards (namely Matrox Millennium
   G450). If Hunt's user interface is extremely laggy, then set
   this cvar to 0.

ui_prechache            [0 or 1, default is 1] INTEGER
   If set to 0, the UI will no longer precache its media.
