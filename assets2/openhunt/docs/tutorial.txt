=== First Contact
===

"Where am I? This doesn't look like Subic 3."

                                           [Keel]

I've tried my best to make acclimation as easy as possible. When
starting Hunt for the first time, all options influencing
gameplay are set to values that result in a game experience most
similiar to Q3A. So don't fiddle with options you don't
understand. Just start up a simple deathmatch (single or multi
player) as usual and try to survive!

What are you waiting for?!




=================================================================
=== Chapter 2
=== At Second Sight
===

I hope you enjoyed your first Hunt match. You surely learned
already a lot about playing Hunt. Now it's time to have a closer
look.

If you've played more than a few seconds you must have taken
notice at least of the following:

   - There's an automatic cloaking feature.
   - You've all weapons from the very beginning.
   - Some weapons work different than before.
   - Health, armour, and ammunition regenerate automatically.

In a Hunt match all players are equipped with the latest Vadrigar
technology, including the Portable Cloaking Device (PCD). This
item consumes a lot of power from the Micro Fusion Reactor (MFR)
that also supplies your weapons. So, the PCD switches off as soon
as you begin to shoot. When you stop shooting the PCD is turned
on again three seconds after the weapon has completed its reload
cycle.

# By default, invisible players appear as in Q3A. You can enable
# a new effect called "glass cloaking" in the setup / gameoptions
# menu. But please note that this effect can reduce your frame
# rate by up to 50%.
#
# In multiplayer matches maybe you want to know which cloaking
# option other players use. Just open the scoreboard in this
# case. Players using glass cloaking are marked by "GC" to the
# left of their head icon.

There's a problem connected to the PCD you should be warned of.
Whenever a projectile, strong force, or electrical charge hits
the photon field created by the PCD a yellowish flash of light is
emitted.

Which leads us immediatly to the new weapons.




=================================================================
=== Chapter 3
=== Some Never Change ... More or Less
===

All weapons have been altered, but some weapons changed only
marginally. These are shotgun, rocket launcher, railgun, and
plasma gun.

The enhanced shotgun inflicts more damage dispersing over a
greater area. More than ever the shotgun is a close combat
weapon. Note that the impetus of the shot will knock you back a
bit. You can prevent this by ducking.

The improved rocket launcher fires a bit faster, but the missiles
are not precise unless fired in a ducked position.

The new railgun has doubled damage and a knock-back so strong
that you can use it to do a "railgun jump." For precise shots you
have to duck, which also reduces knock-back.

The plasma gun is the only weapon that performs less than the
original. It compensates by a huge amount of ammunition and an
explosion splash radius which nearly reaches that of a rocket. In
combination with the plasma balls dispersing (which can be
reduced by ducking) this makes it the weapon of choice for
defensive fire.

Exercise 1: Outside in the lava courtyard of Q3DM15 there're a
mega health and a red armour. Get them without the help of your
rocket launcher or grappling hook.
Exercise 2: Once you reached the red armour stay up there and frag
someone from that position.




=================================================================
=== Chapter 4
=== Be a Missile
===

The gauntlet always was the weapon of last choice. This may be no
longer true for the all new hunter gauntlet. It contains a lot of
fine Vadrigar high technology that is directly connected to your
bionic implants.

First of all, when you select the weapon you're provided a wider
field of view. That need not be too useful, but it looks cool and
"aggressive!"

Now, if you point to an uncloaked enemy your target is marked by
a green glowing hull. When you fire the gauntlet on such a marked
target, its computer brain will automatically take over control
of your movements. The attack logic build into the gauntlet lets
you run directly to the enemy. If the enemy moves, you instantly
turn to the new direction. The high signal processing capacity of
the hunter gauntlet even lets you run 10% faster!

But beware:

   - The targeting sensors are not able to detect obstacles like
     an abyss or a lava pond that may be between you and the
     target. To immediatly regain full control of your movements,
     just stop firing.

   - The gauntlet contains a small targeting distortion device.
     This means that the gauntlet is not able to detect players
     who also wear the gauntlet.

If you do not have a marked target it's still possible to fire
the gauntlet. It then behaves much like the old gauntlet. This
especially means that there's no automatic aiming support and
you're limited to normal run speed.

When you have to ward off a gauntlet attack there're usually
three options:

   - Fight back. If you use a concussive weapon (like rocket
     launcher or railgun) the enemy might loose its target. Light
     weapons like the plasma or lightning gun are less
     recommendable. As a close combat weapon the shotgun is
     another useful weapon to answer a gauntlet attack.

   - Retreat without shooting. As soon as you become cloaked the
     enemy will loose its target. Of course, he might choose to
     hunt you manually, but this won't be easy as he'll be
     limited to the same speed as you.

   - Maneuver in such a way that there's an obstacle between you
     and the attacker. Jump pads and teleporters are very useful
     for that purpose. Remember that the gauntlet's attack
     processor always follows the bee-line. If you stand on top
     of a staircase a small lateral move may be enough to thwart
     the attack.

Exercise: Frag someone solely with your gauntlet.




=================================================================
=== Chapter 5
=== Bullets over Broadway
===

The machine gun received a very strong boost. It's really a heavy
and deadly weapon now. The drawback is that it's no longer easy
to handle. Usage of the machine gun should always be
well-considered.

The problem is that the machine gun in distinction from any other
weapon does not instantly shoot. Before the first shot is
released the weapon has to complete a short start-up phase.
There's also a stopping phase that has to be completed to
finally reach the idle state.

Even worse, these phases can't be interrupted. If you stop
shooting just for a moment the weapon merciless grinds to a halt
before it'll restart.

Note that the gun's got an increased spread that can be reduced
to the former extent by ducking.

Being attacked by machine gun is always a dangerous situation.
With bullets driving in it may be difficult to move, especially
if you have to keep from falling off a ledge. So it's generally a
good idea to immediatly look for cover -- even if you're healthy
enough to stand the attack for a while. As soon as you take
cover, you gain an advantage. The enemy is either going to waste
ammunition or has to turn off its gun. In the latter case it's a
clever tactic to immediatly start a counter-attack.

Exercise 1: Frag someone solely with your machine gun.
Exercise 2: Use your plasma gun to drive away an enemy attacking
with the machine gun. Note that this is not recommended practice,
but it's an instructive experience.




=================================================================
=== Chapter 6
=== Great Balls of Fire
===

Like the gauntlet the grenade launcher used to have only a few
friends. This may change with the new version.

The most obvious feature of the enhanced grenade launcher is its
high rate of fire. You're now able to throw more than three
grenades per second, and the time fuse has been extended to five
seconds. Together these features make it possible to cover a
large area with grenades. Imagine what happens if someone enters
such an area, considering that grenades now explode if they get
damaged.

Another nice feature is that grenades may use jump pads and
teleporters. Throw some grenades behind an opponent trying to
escape by way of these and he's likely to get problems on
arrival. Note that actually all slow missiles (i.e. grenades,
rockets, plasma balls, and BFG bolts) are able to use
teleporters, but only grenades ride jump pads.

As the rocket launcher the grenade launcher pushes you back a bit
unless fired in a ducked position. The spread is also reduced by
ducking.

Grenades being shootable makes them less useful for direct
attacks. The opponent might choose to cover you with a cloud of
plasma balls which make your grenades explode right in your face.

Exercise: Frag someone solely with your grenade launcher.




=================================================================
=== Chapter 7
=== Charge Your Enemies
===

The improved lightning gun is an incredible valuable weapon in
some situations, especially defence. Compare it to the sting of a
bee or wasp: rarely deadly, but it easily expels your enemies.

The gadget works by creating a directed high-voltage electric
field. Even though it's more limited in range than the old
weapon, there's one big advantage resulting from this field:
within certain limits it's self-aiming. Just point roughly to
your target and the electric field will short circuit with it,
provided it's near enough. If there're multiple possible targets,
the beam randomly alternates between them.

Once the beam connects to a target, it (the target, of course)
will receive an electric charge. The longer the connection lasts,
the more charge is accumulated.

This charge is very unhealthy. It harms your target in several
ways:

   - It causes continuous damage. At first, armour is eaten up,
     then health. This process runs the faster the more charge
     has been accumulated.

   - There's neither automatic health nor armour regeneration as
     long as there's some charge left over. The regeneration
     powerup still works, though.

   - Discharge flashes shoot out of the victim that not only
     reveal its position even if it's cloaked but also easily
     create some degree of disorder.

When someone's charging you, a charge counter is displayed in
your HUD, that shows how much charge has been accumulated, i.e.
how many seconds it'll last until the charge has been completely
discharged by itself. If you collect a health item it'll not
increase your health but neutralize some amount of charge (one
second per 10 health points).

In team games the weapon charges twice as fast as in non-team
games, but charged players are able to discharge partly on
uncharged (or at least less charged) team members by walking near
them. It's not possible to discharge on members of the opposing
team.

Exercise: Frag someone solely with your lightning gun.




=================================================================
=== Chapter 8
=== Let There Be Light
===

The BFG-10K was the most powerful weapon a gladiator of the arena
eternal could possess. Now, the BFG-11K is available. I've heard
TankJr uses it to enlarge doorways.

CAUTION: Always handle this weapon with great care! You wouldn't
be the first one who underestimated its splash radius.

I hope there's no need to explain why or under what circumstances
a big explosion could be useful. However, the consistent design
of this weapon for a sole purpose created some drawbacks any user
should be aware of. To cite p. 8137 of the BFG-11K User's Manual:
"The acquisition of this device tacitly annulled your life
insurance."

One of the most dangerous aspects (for the user, of course) is
the extremely long reload period. The internal energy systems of
the weapon need 4 seconds to prepare the next shot. Hopefully
you've a plan B on hand if an enemy survives the impact.

The BFG-10K used to create extremely fast plasma bolts.
Unfortunately this is not possible with the BFG-11K. The high
pressure plasma bolts generated by the new weapon are just too
unstable to survive even the speed of a rocket. The actual speed
is something about 75% of that of a rocket.

It should be clear by now that precision is the key to successful
usage of this weapon. It's absolutely recommended to duck for the
shot. But you can even do more. Keep in mind: the explosion can
become very big, but it can only fill the available space. By
carefully choosing the target you may be able to force the
explosion into a specific direction or concentrate the entire
power into a small volume.

# The new BFG bolt creates a lens flare effect. You can disable
# this in the setup / gameoptions menu.
# If you disabled the blood option for performance reasons you
# may want to disable "High Quality BFG Explosion," too.

Exercise: Catch Ranger with your BFG at Q3DM1 when he tries to
get the red armour.




Congratulations! You mastered all weapons. Now it's time to
introduce new features.




=================================================================
=== Chapter 9
=== Hunter and Collector
===

The Vadrigar have developed a new alloy for use as armour that is
much firmer than the old one. It won't give more protection, but
instead of dissolving on the impact of bolts or projectiles it'll
break into pieces. These fragments can then be recollected and
become recycled automatically.

# To let the game create armour fragments you have to set up a
# new match. At the second "GAME SERVER" page (where you select
# things like open player slots or frag limit) click on "ADVANCED
# OPTIONS" at the bottom of the screen. A new page opens where
# you can enable an option called "Generate Armour Fragments."
# Click on "BACK" and continue as usual.
#
# Please note: I suspect this option to create a lot of network
# traffic (not tested, though). It might have inacceptable
# consequences on slow WAN connections. There shouldn't be any
# problems with LAN or single player games.

Armour breaks into chunks of different size. Collecting small
fragments increase your armour by 5, the bigger pieces give 25
points. Pick up a piece of armour by just walking over it.

It's not guaranteed that your armour plates break "correctly."
Under circumstances that are outside of your or your enemies
control even the enhanced armour dissolves. On average 50% of the
armour penetrated by an attack dissolves. So, when you pick up
the fragments after an intense fight you generally end up with
less armour than you'd before. Note that the lightning gun always
dissolves armour.

The new alloy is unstable while not connected to a power supply.
Broken pieces lying on the floor will dissolve if not picked up
within 30 seconds.




=================================================================
=== Chapter 10
=== Tarzan's Heir
===

Beside many weapons you may also carry a powerful device that can
be used to reach otherwise inaccessible places: the grappling
hook.

This apparatus consists of four parts:

   1. discharging appliance
   2. hook
   3. rope
   4. winch

You can throw the hook manually or by use of the discharging
appliance. In either case, once the hook attaches to a wall or
player, the winch starts to rewind the rope automatically.

The grappling hook is available in several styles of contruction:

   - "classic"
   - "tool"
   - "anchor"
   - "combat"

The classic hook's projectile flies fast, displaying a straight
trajectory. The rope rewinds fast and pulls you straight to the
destination. When using the discharging appliance, the rope is
cut as soon as you release the trigger.

The other hooks use an old fashioned rope that bends around
corners. The advantage is that some obstacles are easier to
overcome. The disadvantage is that some other obstacles are more
difficult to overcome.

The tool hook's discharging appliance has very limited power. The
hook will fall back to the floor after some metres, so you need
to aim somewhere above the intended destination. Note that the
hook's range is even shorter when thrown off hand. The winch is
slow, so this device normally isn't useful to escape your
opponents. Once you reach the destination, the rope is cut
automatically.

The anchor hook is much like the tool hook, but the discharging
appliance is much stronger, so you can aim directly to the
intended destination. Also, the rope is not cut automatically, so
you can use this device to hang at the ceiling, for example.

The combat hook works like the anchor hook, but the winch is much
faster, and the discharging appliance can be used without
switching to it.

# Note that the grappling hook is disabled by default. To enable
# it, create a new game, open the advanced options page, and set
# "Grappling Hook Mode" to the desired type.
#
# Additionally, you may want to bind a key to "toggle grappling
# hook" or "throw grappling hook" at the "shoot" section of the
# "setup / controls" menu. These keys can both be used to throw
# the hook and cutting the rope. The difference is, the "throw
# grappling hook" key needs to be held down, while the other
# alternatingly launches the hook and cuts the rope.
#
# By default, you can cut the rope by crouching. This can be
# disabled at the same page.




=================================================================
=== Chapter 11
=== Class Struggle, Part 1
===

Carrying nine different weapons, holding different amounts of
ammuntion, which is regenerated at different rates ... sometimes
it's hard to find the weapon that best suits a particular
purpose.

Fortunatly a remedy is available. The Weapon Control System (WCS)
automatically selects the weapon that best fits the purpose you
specify. But beware: some familiarization is required before
you're able to fully exploit its potential.

To tell the WCS about your needs you choose one of six weapon
categories. The WCS then selects the best weapon of the choosen
category that loads enough ammunition ("enough" means 50% by
default).

# Before you can use the WCS you have to set up a few key
# bindings. In the setup / controls menu choose the new "SWITCH"
# section. There're a lot of entries, but most of them can be
# left alone by now. Just define keys for "best weapon," "skip
# weapon," "next category," and "previous category." In the
# following these keys are called the "WCS keys."
#
# Example: I use W-A-S-D as the movement keys. My WCS keys are
#
#     best weapon          F
#     skip weapon          R
#     next category        E
#     previous category    Q
# (Assuming a German or US keyboard layout. This could be very
# odd with other keyboards.)
#
# At the beginning of a match the WCS is inactive. To activate it
# press the "next category" or "previous category" key. Once the
# WCS is active, the name of the current category is displayed at
# the bottom left corner of your HUD, just above the ammunition
# display. If you want to disable it, press and hold the "skip
# weapon" key for a few seconds.
#
# In the "SHOOT" section of the setup / controls menu there's an
# option called "autoswitch weapons." This option is now used to
# determine whether the WCS should automatically switch to a
# better weapon once it got enough ammunition ("autoswitch
# weapons" set to "on") or if it should only switch weapons when
# said to ("autoswitch weapons" set to "off"). Note that
# autoswitching is temporarily disabled when you select a weapon
# manually (i.e. by use of the old weapon selection keys). The
# category display is then drawn in a gray shade to show this.
# Autoswitching is re-enabled as soon as you press any of the WCS
# keys. Also note that autoswitching never swichtes to a worse
# weapon, even if the current is below the ammunition limit.
# Finally, autoswitching is also suppressed while you're firing.

In general, using the WCS follows specific patterns. The easiest
is to use manual selection if you want a specific weapon for its
special features. If autoswitching is enabled, you may even want
to manually select your current weapon, to prevent autoswitching
to another weapon during combat. Manual selection is usually
ended by use of the "best weapon" function.

Even if autoswitching is enabled, the "best weapon" function is
frequently used immediatly after a fight, to ensure the current
weapon still contains enough ammunition. In this sense, the "best
weapon" function is used like the "reload" function in other
games (e.g. Counterstrike).

If the WCS selects a weapon you don't like, you should consider
changing the weapon category. If the category is ok, just skip to
another weapon. A usual reason for this is that some weapons
generate noise even while idle (note that Hunt bots hear these
noises). You may want to skip to a non-noisy weapon while there's
no enemy in sight, and switch back to the best weapon as soon as
combat begins.

Exercise: Win a match without ever manually selecting a weapon.
Note that this is not recommended practice, but it's an
instructive experience.




=================================================================
=== Chapter 12
=== Class Struggle, Part 2
===

If you very often have to skip weapons, this may mean either that
you use the wrong weapon categories or that the predefined
categories don't match your favorite style of weapon usage. In
the latter case feel free to adjust them.

# In the "SWITCH" section of the setup / controls menu, there's a
# line that reads "category 1/6." Click on this to select the
# category you want to adjust. You can now adjust the name, the
# key, and the weapon's order of precedence for the selected
# category.
#
# The category key can be used as a shortcut to that category.
#
# To change the order of precedence click on a weapon of which
# you want to adjust the rank. Then click on the new position the
# weapon should be. To cancel the movement just click on its old
# position. Repeat until the order of precedence is to your
# liking.




=================================================================
=== Chapter 13
=== In the Realm of Death
===

"You are now wanted 'dead or alive' -- and you know my
preference."
                                                   [Bones]


In my opinion, one of the most important features of Q3A is that
there's no "You've been killed. Game over." You can nearly
instantly respawn after being killed. No need to restart a level,
no need to save the game, no need to load save games, no need to
await the end of a match. Just playing, playing, playing.

On the other hand, in a CTF game it can be a bit frustrating to
face the same enemy you fragged a second before. Even other game
types can be more interesting with a small retardation for those
who get fragged. A long delay even involves a complete change in
gameplay.

# To delay respawning, you have to set up a new match. Adjust the
# respawn delay at the second "GAME SERVER" page, just below the
# time limit. The value is the number of seconds the delay should
# last (0 to 999).
#
# Note that there's no respawn delay option for tournament games.
# It just doesn't make sense in a one-on-one match.

To make awaiting the end of the respawn delay be a bit less
boring it's possible to fly around like a spectator (you can't
switch to follow-mode, though). Once the respawn delay times out,
you can respawn as usual or fly further around. In some cases you
have the option to respawn at your current location or at your
place of death (POD).

Respawning at your current location is only possible in team
games and only if the respawn delay is 10 seconds or longer. In
CTF games respawning at your current location is not possible
while at the opponent's part of the map. Note that it is never
possible to respawn over lava, slime, void, or fog of death, or
inside or on top of another player.

A CTF match may be set up to allow respawning at your place of
death (in addition, respawn delay must be set to at least 10
seconds). In this case, if you die at the opponent's part of the
map, you leave a rotating skull marking your POD. Above the skull
there's a timer which counts down the seconds until respawning.
When the respawn delay times out, you have to respawn within one
second and you have to do it somewhere at the opponent's part of
the map. Otherwise the skull vanishes, forcing you to respawn as
usual. As I noted before it's not possible to respawn inside
another player. So, if someone decides to stand right over the
skull during the critical second, you're not allowed to respawn
at the POD.

Some special rules are connected with respawn delay. In non-team
games, if a player manages to be the last survivor, he'll receive
a "last-man-standing" bonus of 5 points. All other players get a
message about being exterminated and respawn immediately.

In team deathmatches it may happen that one team completely roots
out the other team. The attacker and his team receive an
"overkill" bonus of 5 points then. If the last frag was a
suicide, the suicide and his team receive a "self-extermination"
penalty of -5 points instead. In both cases all dead players
respawn immediately.

In CTF games there's no bonus connected with exterminating the
opponents. It's just a "bit" easier to capture the flag. Whenever
a flag is captured all dead players respawn immediately.

To avoid unfair situations when respawning all dead players, the
living one's health is set to the value they would have if they
would have respawned, too (given they have less than that).

Exercise: Win a match set up with a respawn delay of at least ten
seconds.




=================================================================
=== Chapter 14
=== Breathless
===

You've learned nearly everything you need to know to survive on
your own. But before you are allowed to enter the realm of team
combat, you have to master a last challenge. You must defeat your
human weakness.

# Set up a new match. At the "ADVANCED OPTIONS" page enable the
# option labeled "limited stamina."

Once the Vadrigar have burden you with the plague of
short-windedness, you should carefully consider every move. Only
run if necessary. Avoid jumps whenever possible. If you feel
exhausted, you may even choose to rest for a while.

It's unwise to reach the limit. You become slower and begin to
pant. The latter can be very nasty if you try to hide. If
absolutely necessary, you can hold your breath.

# To be able to do this you have to assign a key to "hold breath"
# in the "MISC" section of the setup / controls menu.

Exercise: Win a match set up with limited stamina.




Congratulations! You are now an experienced and valuable Hunter.
The Vadrigar offer you the opportunity to join the Hunter's Team
League.




=================================================================
=== Chapter 15
=== Composing Forces
===

To form a team means more than a couple of players wearing the
same uniform. Co-ordination is the key to success. Unfortunatly,
with the old system of team orders it wasn't easy to make the
members of a team work together and support each other.
Fortunatly, a remedy is now available: the Tactical Support
System (TSS). It can be used with both team deathmatches and CTF
matches.

The basic idea is this. The team leader, now called the "mission
leader," programs the TSS on an abstract, strategic level. The
TSS then continuously analyses combat and computes appropriate
commands for each player.

From the point of view of a player the TSS consists of three
parts:

   - the Tactical Command Computer (TCC), one for each team
   - the TSS Interface, connected to the HUD
   - the Tactical Display (TD), also connected to the HUD

The TCC is the central component that does all tactical
computations. It knows everything about its own team, nothing
about the opposing team, and -- in CTF matches -- at any time the
exact position of both(!) flags.

The TSS Interface is used by the mission leader to instruct the
TCC. It also provides a few services (like voting for a new
mission leader) to all players. These services are optional, so
only the mission leader is required to have access to the TSS
Interface.

The Tactical Display is shown in the lower left corner of the
HUD. It displays commands and information received from the TCC.
Also available, and enabled by default, is the navigation aid, a
green line floating on the floor, indicating the shortest way to
the goal (given the TCC provided one).

The TD consists of at least the following elements:

   - a group icon
   - a mission description
   - a task (or command) description

According to the instructions of the mission leader the TCC
divides the team into up to 10 groups, labeled from "A" to "J."
The group icon indicates which group you're assigned to. Group
icons are also displayed above the heads of your team mates, so
you can easily tell whether another player is supposed to
co-operate with you.

# If the console variable "cg_drawFriend" is set to 0 (zero), no
# group icons are displayed above the heads of your team mates.
# This variable is not introduced by the Hunt mod, so its value
# is inherited from your "baseq3/q3config.cfg" file when Hunt is
# started for the first time. A local copy is then stored in
# "hunt/q3config.cfg."

The mission leader assigns a mission to each group, e.g. "Capture
Enemy Flag" or "Defend Our Flag." This is displayed in your HUD
to let you know about the overall goal of your group. Your
individual task, as determined by the TCC, is displayed below the
mission description. Examples for tasks are "Support Grunt",
"Protect Anarki," or "Fulfil mission." Note that the navigation
aid always refers to the task, not the mission.

The group icon also shows your status:

   - ready for action (white icon)
   - ready for action and leading the group (yellow icon)
   - not ready for action (black icon)

Usually, the group leader receives the task "Fulfil mission,"
while the other group members are commanded to "Support <leader>"
or "Stick to <leader>." Non-leaders sometimes receive the command
"Go! Go! Go!," which indicates that they should try to fulfil the
mission independently and by any means.

# To make use of the TSS at least the mission leader must have
# assigned a key to "TSS Interface" in the "MISC" section of the
# setup / controls menu.
#
# Additionally, the TSS must be enabled at the "ADVANCED OPTIONS"
# page. Note that due to technical limitations it's currently not
# possible for human mission leaders to make use of the TSS on a
# pure server, so you should disable the pure server option as
# well. It's planned to overcome this limitation in future
# versions of Hunt. Bots can use the TSS on a pure server
# already.
#
# To have a first try at the TSS is easy. Prepare a CTF match.
# Once you entered the game, open the TSS Interface. There should
# be a line that reads "Mission control is off-line." If you
# can't find this line, another player is the mission leader.
# Only the mission leader can turn on mission control.
#
# The word "off-line" should appear in bright white, indicating
# that it can be manipulated. If it's not, TSS has been disabled.
# You have to set up a new game and make sure the TSS is enabled
# and the pure server option is disabled then.
#
# Otherwise, click on "off-line." It should change to "on-line."
# That's it. After a few seconds all members of your team
# (including yourself) should receive commands from the TCC. You
# can close the TSS Interface by pressing "ESC," "F12," or by
# clicking on "resume game" at the upper right corner of the TSS
# Interface.
#
# If nothing happens after switching mission control on-line, the
# TSS wasn't able to find a valid strategy file. There must be at
# least one *.hst file at "hunt/tss/ctf" or "hunt/tss/tdm,"
# depending on the game type. If you don't have strategy files
# you may create some yourself, this is covered by later
# chapters. Until then you may teamvote for a bot as the mission
# leader (bots do not depend on the existence of *.hst files).
# You can use the TSS Interface to call a teamvote.

Exercise: Make use of the TSS in a CTF match. There may be things
you don't understand. Just ignore them by now.




=================================================================
=== Chapter 16
=== Mission Impossible
===

The mission descriptions appearing in the Tactical Display depend
on the game type and the instructions of the mission leader (as
you didn't give any instructions to the TCC, it applies default
instructions). The following list shows the complete range of
missions.

   - Seek Enemy (TDM & CTF)
     Seek and destroy any opponent. All group members are allowed
     to open fire within their own discretion.

   - Seek Items (TDM & CTF)
     Seek and collect any item. Group members should fight only
     when being attacked.

   - Capture Red/Blue Flag (CTF only)
     Take possession of the opponent's flag and bring it to your
     home base. In general, group members should fight only when
     being attacked. When assaulting the opponent's base or
     possessing the flag, all group members are allowed to open
     fire to their own judgement.

     Once the group possesses the flag, the group leader's task
     is to lead the flag carrier to the home base, while the
     other group members should try to protect the flag carrier.

     If the group leader gets the flag, another group member
     automatically becomes the leader.

     When there's no group leader, the group leader is too far
     away from the flag carrier, or the flag carrier is under
     attack, he'll be commanded to rush to the home base on his
     own.

   - Defend Red/Blue Flag (CTF only)
     Try to prevent the opposing team from taking away your
     team's flag. All group members should attack intruders as
     soon as they're discovered.

     If an opponent is successful in capturing the flag, the
     mission changes to "Return Red/Blue Flag," indicating that
     the group should chase the flag carrier. Other opponents
     should be ignored if possible.

   - Defend Red/Blue Base (CTF only)
     Keep all opponents from entering your team's base. All group
     members should attack intruders as soon as they're
     discovered. Opponents -- even the flag carrier -- should not
     be chased.

   - Occupy Red/Blue Base (CTF only)
     Expel the opponents from their own base, but don't chase
     them. If the opponent's flag is returned, the group should
     try to catch it.

     If your team's flag carrier is near the opponent's base and
     not being supported by a group leader, this group will be
     commanded to protect the flag carrier.




=================================================================
=== Chapter 17
=== The Three Commandments
===

Apart from the heavy responsibility that rests on you, being a
group leader is easy. You lead the way, the ranks follow.

Sometimes, this isn't desirable. For example, when you chase the
enemy's flag carrier, your comrades better chase the enemy,
instead of you. If you manage to return the flag, some of your
subordinates may already be near the base (perhaps they have been
fragged or left the group to pick up an item). It would be stupid
if they left the flag just to meet you.

As the group leader you control your subordinates by means of
three commands. These group commands are

   - "Stick to me!"
     All group members ready for action should stay near you,
     whatever happens.

   - "Support me!"
     In general, all group members ready for action should stay
     near you, but may leave you to chase an enemy or pick up an
     item. Group members near the mission goal should proceed to
     there.

   - "Go! Go! Go!"
     All group members ready for action should try to fulfil the
     mission on their own.

Note that players not ready for action (this is decided by the
TCC according to instructions given by the mission leader) are
always out of your control.

Group commands are communicated to your team mates through the
TCC by assigning appropriate tasks. Of course, it's up to them
whether they respect your commands. At least bots will always try
to meet your wishes.

Group leaders find additional information on their Tactical
Display that may be useful when deciding how to fulfil the
mission:

   - the current group command

   - something like "[x/y/z]", where
      - "x" is the number of group members ready for action
      - "y" is the number of group members alive
      - "z" is the total number of group members, including dead
        players

      Note that "x," "y," and "z" include the group leader.

Especially newbies are afraid of deciding about group commands.
Some players just don't want to rack their brains for something
like that. So, by default, group commands are actually decided by
the TCC.

# This means that two steps are needed to manually place group
# commands.
#
# 1. Assign keys to the group commands in the "MISC" section of
#    the setup / controls menu.
#
# 2. Switch off the "Auto Group Leader Command" option in the
#    setup / gameoptions menu.

=== Chapter 18
=== Use Me
===

# To make use of the TSS Interface you have to know a few general
# rules.
#
# Everything that is printed in gray is descriptive text; you've
# no direct control over it. On the other hand, things printed in
# white can be manipulated. Move the cursor over such an item by
# use of the mouse or cursor keys. It'll change its color to
# yellow, indicating that it's ready to be manipulated or used.
#
# There're basically three different types of manipulatable
# items:
#
#    - variables
#      These come in two flavors: number and text variables.
#
#    - buttons
#      You recognize a button by its brighter background.
#
#    - text input fields
#      These can be recognized by their darker background.
#
# A number variable can be manipulated in the following ways:
#
#    - increase
#       - by one
#          mouse wheel up
#          shift + cursor up
#          shift + cursor right
#          PgUp
#          "+"
#
#       - by five
#          ctrl + mouse wheel up
#          ctrl + cursor up
#          ctrl + cursor right
#          ctrl + PgUp
#
#    - decrease
#       - by one
#          mouse wheel down
#          shift + cursor down
#          shift + cursor left
#          PgDn
#          "-"
#
#       - by five
#          ctrl + mouse wheel down
#          ctrl + cursor down
#          ctrl + cursor left
#          ctrl + PgDn
#
#    - miscellaneous
#       - reset to zero
#          backspace
#          delete
#
#       - set to minimum
#          shift + Home
#          ctrl + Home
#
#       - set to maximum
#          shift + End
#          ctrl + End
#
#       - switch (only with binary variables)
#          left mouse button
#          right mouse button
#          return
#          enter
#          space
#
# If you aren't comfortable in learning this by heart, just use
# your mouse wheel to change a variable. You may also click on
# variables that switch between two different values.
#
# For example, near the top of the TSS Interface there's a line
# that reads "Page #1/5: Personal Services". The "1" is the
# current value of a number variable that controls the page to be
# displayed by the TSS Interface. Try to view the other pages of
# the TSS Interface, then turn back to page #1.
#
# Text variables are controlled in the same way as number
# variables; the "increase"/"decrease" keys flip through the
# available states.
#
# For example, the page title (e.g. "Personal Services") is
# actually the textual representation of the variable that
# controls the page. As the page number it can be used to flip
# through the available pages.
#
# Buttons can be activated by the following keys:
#    left mouse button
#    right mouse button
#    return
#    enter
#    space
#
# For example, there's a button at the upper right corner of the
# TSS Interface, entitled "resume game". It closes the TSS
# Interface when activated.
#
# Use a text input field by moving the cursor at the position
# where you want to insert some text, then type it. Home, End,
# Backspace, and Delete do what they are supposed to. The Insert
# key does not work: input is always inserted, there's no
# overstrike mode.
#
# If you want to try out a text input field without damaging
# something (oh, by the way: opening the TSS Interface tacitly
# annulled your life insurance), go to page #3 ("Strategy").
# At section #1 ("Stock") find the entry "sort by access date
# (#2/5)" and change it to "sort by pattern similarity (#5/5)."
# Now, at the bottom right corner you'll find a text input field
# (entitled "Pattern") in which you can enter whatever you like.




=================================================================
=== Chapter 19
=== Personal Affairs
===

While pages 2 to 5 are accessible by the mission leader only, the
first page provides services to all players (with a few
additional services for the mission leader).

Services and information provided to all players are:

   - the name of the mission leader

   - voting for another mission leader

   - voting for surrendering the current round

   - enabling / disabling the navigation aid (available only
     while mission control is on-line)

   - the current group command (available only while mission
     control is on-line)

   - selecting a group command (available only for group leaders)

   - the number of players for each team

Services and information provided to the mission leader only are:

   - enabling / disabling mission control

   - the number of players alive for each team

   - entering safety mode (available only in certain cases, see
     below)

Surrendering may be useful when playing with a long respawn
delay, especially if the only remaining players are bots. If the
vote succeeds all players respawn immediately. The victorious
team scores two points in CTF matches and five points in team
deathmatches respectively.

A serious mission leader might complain that it's difficult to
program the TSS and defend one's life at the same time. You might
want to enter the safety mode in this case. You can fly around
like a spectator, can't be seen nor shot (nor shoot, of course),
but still use the TSS Interface to command your troops. You can
leave the safety mode at any time (by use of the same button you
used to enter it). If you do, you'll respawn at a random respawn
point.

To be able to enter the safety mode, all of the following
conditions must be met:

   1. Mission control must be on-line.
   2. You mustn't be the only player of your team.
   3. Your health mustn't be below the base health (300 by
      default).
   4. Your weapon must be idle.

Conditions #3 and 4 aim to prevent abuse of this service. For
team deathmatches with respawn delay it's important to know that
a mission leader who entered the safety mode is considered to be
dead.




=================================================================
=== Chapter 20
=== Personnel Affairs
===

Since group leaders have a larger influence on combat than other
players, it's desirable to leave this responsibility to more able
or more experienced players. Though it is not possible to force
certain players to be group leaders, the mission leader can
express strong recommendations.

This is done at page 2 ("Groups") of the TSS Interface. At
section 1 ("Designated Leaders") each group can be assigned a
first, second, and third leader. Think of the second and third
leaders as vice-leaders.

The TCC prefers designated leaders when assigning players to
groups and determining group leaders. It refuses them when
they're dead, not ready for action, or much too far away from the
mission goal. When a designated leader becomes a group leader,
his group icon is surrounded by a ring.




=================================================================
=== Chapter 21
=== The Tools of Success
===

The most important task of the mission leader is to decide on how
the team should act and react in combat. In general, to describe
this in every detail is a task much too complex to do during the
battle. Instead, you just choose between a few plans you or
others prepared ealier. In TSS terminology these plans are called
"strategies."

Though Hunt ships with only a few, it's able to manage a stock of
up to 1000 strategies. Choosing from a list of dozens or even
hundreds of strategies can still be somewhat difficult with a
couple of rockets approaching and comrades shrieking for help.
So, the TSS Interface provides means to create a choice, the
"palette" as it is called, from which you select the one strategy
that the TCC should apply.

The palette provides space for up to 26 strategies, labeled from
"a" to "z." There're an "applied" strategy, which is the one used
by the TCC, and a "selected" one, which may be removed (from the
palette), applied, or edited.

The TSS Interface differentiates between the file name and the
TSS name of a strategy. Due to technical limitations it's not
possible to delete or rename a strategy file within Hunt. Use
your operating system's file services for this purpose. On the
other hand, the TSS name *can* be edited using the TSS Interface,
so this name is used to identify and search for strategies. Since
TSS names don't need to be unique, there's also a unique number
(called "ID#," ranging from "000" to "999") assigned to each
strategy.

# The palette and the stock are found at page 3 ("Strategy") of
# the TSS Interface. To add a strategy to the palette use the
# "+" button to the left of the strategies in the stock. When
# the stock is large, put the cursor on one of the TSS names and
# use the keys for modifying a number variable to scroll through
# the list. For example, you can use the mouse wheel to scroll,
# Shift+Home and Shift+End to skip to the start and end of the
# list, respectively.
#
# There're several ways to find a specific strategy in a large
# stock. If you now the ID#, you can enter it in the text input
# field at the bottom left corner of the TSS Interface. If you
# know that it's somewhere near the selected strategy, use the
# "search #nnn" button ("nnn" is always the ID# of the selected
# strategy). It may be helpful to change the sort order. The
# following sort orders are available:
#
#    - sort by creation date
#      The strategy at last created is sorted at the top of the
#      stock.
#
#    - sort by access date
#      The strategy at last added to the palette is sorted at the
#      top of the stock.
#
#    - sort by name / creation date
#      The stock is sorted alphabetically. Strategies with
#      identical TSS names are sorted by creation date.
#
#    - sort by name / access date
#      The stock is sorted alphabetically. Strategies with
#      identical TSS names are sorted by access date.
#
#    - sort by pattern similarity
#      At the bottom right corner of the TSS Interface appears a
#      text field labeled "Pattern." The strategy with a TSS name
#      most similar to the pattern is sorted at the top of the
#      stock.
#
# The contents of the palette is saved when you leave a match.

Note that there're actually two stocks: one for team deathmatches
(files are located at "hunt/tss/tdm") and one for CTF games
(files are located at "hunt/tss/ctf"). If you receive files from
other sources, make sure they're put into the right folders. A
wrongly placed strategy file will show up in the stock list, but
you won't be able to add it to the palette.

These are the strategies that ship with the Hunt mod:

   Team Deathmatch Strategies

   - "juhox crowd" (hunt/tss/tdm/tdm_juhox_crowd.hst)
     Your team is divided into as many groups as possible. If
     your team consists of ten or less players, all players will
     be put into a different group.

     Players are supposed to walk independently through the map,
     searching for enemies. Once a player becomes involved in a
     fight, the other players are directed to this player.

   - "juhox maxforce" (hunt/tss/tdm/tdm_juhox_maxforce.hst)
     All players of your team are put into a single group. When a
     player becomes endangered (health and armour are low), a
     team mate will be commanded to act as a bodyguard for this
     player.

   - "juhox pliers" (hunt/tss/tdm/tdm_juhox_pliers.hst)
     Your team is divided into two groups that move independently
     from each other. If one group becomes involved in a fight,
     the other group's leader is directed to this group.


   Capture-The-Flag Strategies

   - "juhox simple" (hunt/tss/ctf/ctf_juhox_simple.hst)
     Your team is divided into two groups of equal size. Group
     "A" defends the own flag, group "B" captures the opponent's
     flag.

   - "juhox maxforce" (hunt/tss/ctf/ctf_juhox_maxforce.hst)
     This is a more complex strategy that can be used to break
     strong defence. At the beginning, the entire team is put
     into group "B," commanded to capture the opponent's flag.
     When your team is successful, it's commanded to accompany
     your flag carrier on his way back to the home base. Once the
     flag carrier reaches home ground, the team splits up. A
     minority still remains in group "B" to protect the flag
     carrier, while the majority moves to group "A," commanded to
     return the own flag. Of course, if the own flag is still at
     the base, the team stays together. This is unlikely, though,
     since there wasn't any defence in the beginning.

   - "juhox pliers" (hunt/tss/ctf/ctf_juhox_pliers.hst)
     If you think that the other team is inferior to your, you
     may use this strategy to score captures in the shortest
     possible time. There're three groups of equal size. Group
     "A" is commanded to defend the own flag, group "B" tries to
     capture the opponent's flag, and group "C" should try to
     occupy the opponent's base. Members of group "C" waiting at
     the opponent's base automatically move to group "B" as soon
     as the opponent's flag returns. Beautiful -- and very
     depressing to the opponents! But note that this strategy
     may be difficult to accomplish if the opponents use a
     strategy of maximum force.

   - "juhox powerpliers" (hunt/tss/ctf/ctf_juhox_powerpliers.hst)
     This is a slightly modified version of "juhox pliers." It's
     a bit slower, but may work even if the opponents use a
     strategy of maximum force. The only difference is that, when
     both flags are at your part of the map, the members of group
     "C" are integrated into groups "A" and "B."

Note that there's no "best" strategy. At the beginning of a match
try to select a strategy that fits best to your team's abilities
and worst to the opposing team's ones, taking into account things
like the map, respawn delay, limited stamina, time limit, etc. If
your first choice turns out to be unlucky, choose another one. If
you recognize the strategy of your opponents, you may want to
choose a better one, even if the current strategy is successful.
Your mind may be your strongest weapon.




=================================================================
=== Chapter 22
=== When Ideas Come True, Part 1
===

There's nothing wrong in using other people's strategies, but a
true Master of Hunt surely wants to create his own.

An important aspect of TSS strategies is that they should (and
can, of course) be adaptive. The idea is that the mission leader
should have to consider static and infrequent changing
information only, while adapting to the dynamics of the battle
(i.e. taking tactical decisions) is left to the strategy (or,
more precisely, to the TCC applying the strategy).

To this end a TSS strategy consists of up to 27 conditions, each
defining an occasion and a set of directives. Usually, the TCC
selects a condition automatically ("auto tactics"), but you can
override this and choose the condition manually ("manual
tactics"). Provisional, we'll use manual tactics, as it saves us
defining occasions.

The conditions are labeled "?" and "A" to "Z." Each condition can
be assigned a name, with the exception of the condition "?" which
always is named "default."

The directives of a condition determine how the team should be
divided into groups, what missions these groups should fulfil,
and, to a certain extent, how the missions should be carried out.

To determine the division of your team into groups, you have to
answer the following questions for each group:

   - How many players should be dedicated to this group at least?

   - Of the previous number, how many should be alive at least?
     This is especially important when a respawn delay has been
     set up. Additionally, this is the magnitude the next one
     refers to.

   - Of the previous number, how many should be ready for action
     at least?

Of course, the TCC is not able to revive players, so keeping the
limits can't be guaranteed. When the TCC needs to break limits,
it applies an order of precedence. By default, this means that
the limits of group "A" are broken at last and those of group "J"
first. The order of precedence can be changed, which is
preferable to exchanging the missions, because many players like
it when groups are always in association with specific missions.

To determine goal and behavior of each group, the following
questions have to be answered:

   - What mission is this group going to perform?

   - What is the maximum danger index at which members of this
     group are considered as ready for action?

     The TCC assigns a number called "danger index" (DI) to each
     player, that measures the degree of danger, taking into
     account health, armour, stamina, and lightning charge. The
     following table might give a clue:

        DI=-100 ... very healthy, e.g. health=armour=300
	DI=0 ...... not in danger, e.g. health=300, armour=0
	DI=50 ..... in danger, e.g. health=150, armour=0
	DI=100 .... dead or as good as dead

     The numbers hold for a base health of 300, no handicap, and
     no lightning charge. Low stamina increases the DI by up to
     20.

     If you're not sure about the correct value, just try it out.
     If players complain that they feel perfectly well, but are
     forced to retreat, you should increase the DI limit. On the
     other hand, when your team mates are always fragged in the
     same second the TCC tolds them to retreat, you should
     decrease the DI limit.

   - Of the group members being alive, how many need to be ready
     for action at least?

     If there aren't enough players ready for action, the mission
     is aborted and all members ready for action will be
     commanded to protect the members not ready for action.

   - Of the group members being alive, how many need to be near
     the group leader at least?

     When the group command is "Stick to me!" and there aren't
     enough players near the group leader, the mission is
     aborted.

   - How many bodyguards should be assigned to players not ready
     for action at most?

     This number is only used as long as the mission is not
     aborted.

# As an example, we'll now create a more defensive version of the
# "juhox pliers" (CTF) strategy. Start up a CTF match, preferably
# a single player game without bots, so you'll be undisturbed.
#
# At page 3 of the TSS Interface, section 2, click on the button

#
# That's it. You can try your new strategy in a match if you
# want. If you do, don't forget to tell the TCC to apply it.

Now, what do these numbers mean? Obviously we've now a fourth
group, which is commanded to defend the home base. According to
the limits labeled "total" (in the following called "t-limits"),
all groups are equal in size (if possible).

The more important groups "A" and "B" are set up such that the
TCC keeps at least 50% of their members alive, if possible. A
general rule for this limit (in the following called "a-limit")
is to prefer lower values to higher ones. Using high values may
force the TCC to frequently move players from one group to
another. Most players hate this.

When the a-limits have been set to reasonable values, high values
for the limits labeled "ready" (in the following called
"r-limits") are less critical. So, we just use the default value
of 100%.

Let's say your team consists of 12 players (alright, that's quite
a large team). That makes 3 players per group. In group "A" at
least 2 players need to be alive (1 player would be less than 50%
of 3) and both (100% of them) need to be ready for action.

Defenders can't choose the point of time of their fights, so we
gave them more elbow room by increasing the DI limit to 40. On
the other hand, attacks should be powerful (especially as
attackers have been split up into two independent groups), so the
limits for the number of players ready for action (RP) and the
number of players near the group leader (GS) have been raised to
50% of the players being alive. Remember that these limits
determine whether the mission should be aborted. They must not be
confused with the a-limit, which is used to proper divide the
team into groups.

As frags don't decide victory, bodyguards (BG) are usually not
useful in CTF matches. This can change when using very long
respawn delays, though.

The current configuration makes group "D" be the least
significant one. When there're not enough players alive or ready
for action in group "D," the TCC won't move players from other
groups to it. Perhaps you think that this is not acceptable for a
strategy emphasizing defence. To remedy you could rearrange the
assignment of missions to groups, but perhaps your team mates
don't like this solution. In this case you can rearrange the
order of precedence instead.

# This is done with the "sliders" to the left of the group
# labels. For example, put the cursor at the "=" to the left of
# "[D]." Now use an "increase" key (e.g. "mouse wheel up") two
# times. Group "D" will move to the place previously occupied by
# group "B," while groups "B" and "C" will move one line down. It
# does not matter whether you do this at section 1 or 2, the new
# arrangement automatically holds for both.

=== When Ideas Come True, Part 2
===

The strategy introduced in the previous chapter is still far from
being perfect. It's just not "enough" adaptive. For example, when
the opposing team managed to catch your flag and have their flag
safe at their base, it's wasted power to leave group "D" at your
base. For cases of emergency there should be a seperate
condition.

# Create a CTF match, open the TSS Interface and make sure the
# new strategy is selected. Then go to page 4 and select "A" as
# the condition to be edited. Give it a name, e.g. "Emergency."
#
# At section 1 enter the following values:
#
#    [A] total>=34%     alive>= 0%     ready>=100%
#    [B] total>=33%     alive>= 0%     ready>=100%
#    [C] total>=33%     alive>= 0%     ready>=100%
#    [D] total>= 0%     alive>= 0%     ready>=100%
#    [E] total>= 0%     alive>= 0%     ready>=100%

#    [J] total>= 0%     alive>= 0%     ready>=100%
#
# At section 2 enter the following values:
#
#    [A] defend our flag       DI<=70   RP>= 0%   GS>= 0%   BG<=0
#    [B] capture enemy flag    DI<=70   RP>= 0%   GS>= 0%   BG<=0
#    [C] occupy enemy base     DI<=70   RP>= 0%   GS>= 0%   BG<=0
#    [D] ---                   DI<=25   RP>= 0%   GS>= 0%   BG<=0
#    [E] ---                   DI<=25   RP>= 0%   GS>= 0%   BG<=0
#    [F] ---                   DI<=25   RP>= 0%   GS>= 0%   BG<=0
#    [G] ---                   DI<=25   RP>= 0%   GS>= 0%   BG<=0
#    [H] ---                   DI<=25   RP>= 0%   GS>= 0%   BG<=0
#    [I] ---                   DI<=25   RP>= 0%   GS>= 0%   BG<=0
#    [J] ---                   DI<=25   RP>= 0%   GS>= 0%   BG<=0
#
# In case of emergency you can now select condition "A" to
# mobilize all forces. This is done at the upper half of page 4,
# below the applied strategy.

Note that the a-limits have been set to zero, to as far as
possible prevent the TCC from moving players from one group to
another (players should be undisturbed during an emergency). The
r-limits may be left to the default value, since 100% of zero is
still zero (remember that the r-limit refers to the a-limit, not
to the number of group members being alive).

The limit for the danger index has been raised to 70, so players
are only allowed to retreat when absolutely needed. Consistently,
the other limits have been set to zero, so missions are never
aborted, and no bodyguards are used.




=================================================================
=== Chapter 24
=== In the Realm of the Numbers
===

Manually selecting the condition to be applied by the TCC is
useful for purposes of learning and testing, but for a real match
this should be done automatically. To this end, you have to
specify the occasion of usage for each condition.

The TCC determines the condition to be applied by the following
procedure:

   1. Test whether the occasion of condition "A" fits to the
      current situation of combat. If so, apply condition "A."

   2. If the previous condition could not be applied, try the
      next one.

   3. Step 2 is repeated until an occasion fits, or all
      conditions from "A" to "Z" have been tested. In the latter
      case, the default condition (condition "?") is applied.

To temporarily prevent a condition from being applied, it's
possible to turn them off. Note that, when creating a new
strategy, all conditions (except the default condition) are
turned off. The default condition cannot be turned off.

An occasion consists of up to six clauses. An occasion fits to a
given situation, if at least one of its clauses fits. Like
conditions, clauses can be turned on and off. A clause that is
turned off never fits.

A clause consists of up to ten predicates. A clause fits to a
given situation, if all of its predicates fit. An unused
predicate always fits.

A predicate consists of a magnitude, a comparison operator, and a
constant value (which usually acts as a limit). The following
magnitudes are available:

   - YTS  (#1)
     "Your Team: Size"
     number of players in your team

   - OTS  (#2)
     "Opposing Team: Size"
     number of opponents

   - BTS  (#3)
     "Balance of Team Sizes"
     YTS - OTS

   - RSPD (#4)
     "ReSPawn Delay"
     respawn delay in seconds

   - YAP  (#5)
     "Your team: players Alive, Percentage"

     "Opposing team: players Alive, Quantity"
     number of opponents alive

   - BAP  (#9)
     "Balance of players Alive, Percentage"
     YAP - OAP

     Note: If all players are alive, this is zero, even if the
     teams are different in size. It's assumed that the teams are
     always equal in strength; maybe the larger team consists of
     less skilled players.

     at opponent's base = -100 ... at home base = +100

# Don't worry: you don't need to learn this list by heart, as
# it's also available at page 5 of the TSS Interface.

You can define "medium term" and "long term" as a percentage of
the respawn delay at page 3, section 3 ("Global Adjustments of
the Selected Strategy").

Note that the list of the magnitudes is so lengthy partly because
of all these "balance" magnitudes. These are needed because you
can't compare a magnitude against another one. It's only possible
to compare magnitudes against constants.

The following comparison operators are available:

   - lower
   - lower or equal
   - greater or equal
   - greater
   - equal
   - unequal

Note that the TSS Interface uses the mathematical symbols. As
some of them are not available in 7-bit ASCII, I'll use the
following symbols:

   - lower or equal:   <=
   - greater or equal: >=
   - unequal:          <>

Now let's return to the strategy you created during the previous
chapters. We've to define what "case of emergency" does mean. For
the sake of simplicity, let's use the following definition:

   Emergency: the opposing team has your flag, but your team not
   that of the opposing team

To translate this into something the TCC is able to understand,
you need 1 clause consisting of 2 predicates:

   clause #1:
      YFS = 3-tak (means: your flag has been taken)
      OFS = 1-bas (means: the opp. team's flag is at their base)

# To program this, create a CTF match, open the TSS Interface,
# and make sure your new strategy is selected. Then go to page 4
# and select "A" as the condition to be edited. Make sure that
# this condition is turned on; the switch for this is located to
# the right of the name field of the condition.
#
# Now go to section 3 ("Occasion") and enter the following:
#
# [X] YFS =3-tak  OFS =1-bas  ----------  ----------  ----------
#     ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
#
# [ ] ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
#     ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
#
# [ ] ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
#     ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
#
# [ ] ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
#     ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
#
# [ ] ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
#     ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
#
# [ ] ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
#     ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
#
# Note that the predicates of a clause can edited only while the
# clause is turned on. Click on "[ ]" to turn a clause on.
#
# Asterisks mark predicates and clauses that fit to the current
# situation. This is useful when debugging strategies.
#
# Finally, switch from "Manual Tactics" to "Auto Tactics." The
# switch for this is located directly over the words "Edit
# Condition."

Maybe you're not satisfied with the current definition of
"emergency." What if your flag has been dropped while the
opposing team's flag is still at their base? The TCC could switch
to the emergency condition to enforce returning our flag. Try
this:

   clause #1:
      YFS<> 1-bas (means: your flag is not at home)
      OFS = 1-bas (means: the opp. team's flag is at their base)

Well, if your flag is still near the home base, that's not very
dangerous, so try this one:

   clause #1:
      YFP < +50%  (means: your flag isn't near the home base)
      OFS = 1-bas (means: the opp. team's flag is at their base)

Suppose you're playing with respawn delay and many players of
your team have been fragged, while the other team is still nearly
complete. That's an emergency, too, isn't it? Now you need two
clauses to define emergency:

   clause #1:
      YFP < +50%  (means: your flag isn't near the home base)
      OFS = 1-bas (means: the opp. team's flag is at their base)

   clause #2:
      BAP < -50%  (means: your team lost considerable more
                          players than the other team)

# Enter this as follows:
#
# [X] YFP < +50%  OFS =1-bas  ----------  ----------  ----------
#     ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
#
# [X] BAP < -50%  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
#     ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
#
# [ ] ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
#     ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
#
# [ ] ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
#     ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
#
# [ ] ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
#     ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
#
# [ ] ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
#     ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------

I leave it to you to further refine your strategy.




=================================================================
=== Chapter 25
=== The Greatest Challenge
===

You mastered all challenges of combat from weapon handling to
tactical and strategic planning. Now you're worth to take part in
the greatest battle of this universe.

Only a few know that there's a struggle between the Vadrigar and
a nameless race of beings emerged from the 99th dimension. These
beings try to invade our universe since aeons. They are too
numerous to fight them back. But recently it has been discovered
that they need mysterious artefacts to survive in our world.

For unknown reason all artefacts are concentrated in one
location. We need a small team to intrude this heavily guarded
area, find the artefacts, and collect them. But note that these
artefacts create a chain between the worlds. You can only grab
the artefact that is completely part of our universe. When you
have it, the next one will materialize shortly after.

We don't know the exact location of the artefacts, but you'll be
equipped with an detector. When you're near enough to an artefact
(approximately 100m or 300ft), you'll hear a beep that becomes
faster the closer you get.

Due to interferences caused by the artefacts, we're not able to
regenerate your health or armour, so keep an eye open for useful
items.

There're two types of monsters. They can easily distinguished by
their size.

The small monsters are called "predators." They can only attack
with their claws, so try to keep them distant. Note that they can
jump quite far and high, but they don't run faster than you.

The big monsters are called "guards." They're equipped with a
rocket launcher which can fire at a very high rate. Fortunately,
the guards are a bit clumsy.

A last warning. This is an extremely dangerous task. Be very
careful. Your enemy's sight's bad but their hearing is good. So
make intensive usage of your cloaking device. Only shoot if you
need to. Your only goal is to catch these artefacts! If we come
to the conclusion that the task is beyond your capabilities, the
mission is aborted immediately.

Now go saving the universe. Good luck!

# To accept this challenge set up a new game and choose "Save the
# Universe" as the game type. Note that the map strongly
# influences difficulty. Q3DM6 and Q3DM7 are nice maps of medium
# difficulty. Q3DM12 may be a challenge even for experienced
# players, but this also depends on other factors (see below).
#
# In "Save the Universe" all players (including bots) form a
# single team. Your enemy can be controlled via the "Advanced
# Options" menu. Five options determine the difficulty:
#
#    - Min. # of Monsters
#      If the number of monsters drops below this level, new
#      monsters spawn rapidly until this limit is reached. Valid
#      values are between 0 and 200.
#
#    - Max. # of Monsters
#      The number of monsters never exceeds this limit. Valid
#      values are between 1 and 200.
#
#    - Monster Spawn Delay
#      As long as the number of monsters is between the minimum
#      and maximum level new monsters spawn at this rate. Valid
#      values are between 1 and 999 seconds.
#
#    - Monster Constitution
#      Determines the monster healthiness. Valid values are
#      between 1% and 1000%. The smaller the value the easier the
#      monsters are to kill. Note that 100% is already quite
#      hard.
#
#    - Avg. Part of Monsters Spawning as Guards
#      You can decide how many monsters spawn as a guard by this
#      option. Note that the actual number may differ slightly.
#
# Note that the first monster spawns five seconds after the game
# begins.
#
# You can also determine the models used by the monsters by
# clicking the "Monster Model" options.
#
# The victory condition is always the collection of all
# artefacts. On the other hand, the defeat condition can be
# determined by:
#
#    - fraglimit
#      Limits the number of respawns available for your team.
#      Similar to the "lifes" counter in old 2D shooter days, but
#      this time the counter is shared by all members of the
#      team. Unwise to use with a mixed team (partly experienced
#      players, partly newbies). Note that any death among your
#      team members counts as a frag, independantly of the cause.
#
#    - timelimit
#      Limits the available time. Results in much more action
#      than a fraglimit.

"Over? I haven't found the blue key card yet!"

                                         [Doom]

Congratulations! You just completed this tutorial. You must be a
great warrior. You are not the kind of person who always reads
the last page first, are you?

If you lost your wallet somewhere at Q3DM15, or are still trying
to break holes into walls with your BFG ... don't give up!

Over and out.
